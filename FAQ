1.	What are RC airplanes?
•	Briefly explain what RC airplanes are, including the different types (e.g., electric, gas, nitro), their components, and how they are controlled.

2.	How do I get started with RC airplanes?
In an ideal world, there will be an RC club near you that welcomes beginners. They will have a suitable field, and other enthusiasts to help and inspire you. They can check your model is correctly set up, and connect your transmitter to an instructor's, so they can take over as necessary.
If you don't live near a suitable club, it is entirely possible to learn on your own. You will need to do a lot more research, and will probably crash several times but that doesn't need to be a serious set-back.
In either case, it's well worth spending an hour or two on an RC simulator. Even the free ones are good enough for learning the basics.
It is worth starting with a plane that is designed specifically for beginners. Something slow, stable and tough will be much more likely to survive until you're ready to upgrade.

2. What resources are there?
Lots of people have attempted to summarise everything a beginner needs to know, but they either have to leave a lot out, or go into so much detail that it becomes overwhelming.
The [BMFA "A Flying Start"](http://www.srcfc.org.uk/A%20Flying%20Start.pdf) booklet is a good attempt at the basics.
[RC Groups Beginner Training Area (Aircraft-Electric)](https://www.rcgroups.com/beginner-training-area-aircraft-electric-8/) is a forum with a huge amount of information and discussion, with 'sticky' posts at the top for the most important things.

3.	Where can I find information on RC airplane models?
•	List websites, forums, and other online resources where users can find information on different RC airplane models, including reviews, specifications, and user experiences.

4.	How do I choose the right RC airplane for me as a beginner?
There is no perfect beginner airplane. Small, light planes are more likely to survive crashing, but can be twitchy and get blown around by even a light wind. They're good if you're learning on your own and have the flexibility (and patience) to wait for calm weather. Larger models are more suitable for a club when you have an instructor to take over, but have to fly when you're both free.
Models with electronic stability assistance are much easier to fly, but are more expensive (and it can't prevent all crashes, such as getting stuck in a tree).
High-wing trainers are known for their stability and ease of control, making them ideal for beginners to learn the basics of flying RC airplanes. 
Here are a few popular options:
*.	HobbyZone Sport Cub S: This is a popular micro RTF. It has a durable construction, self-leveling technology known as SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) that helps prevent crashes.
*.	E-flite Apprentice STS: This is another popular RTF model that offers a more advanced option for beginners. It features a larger wingspan and more powerful motor, allowing for smoother and more stable flights. It also includes SAFE technology, and comes with a Spektrum DXe transmitter, which can be used with other Spektrum receivers for future planes.
*.  E-flite Aeroscout S2 1.1m: Similar to the Apprentice except less realistic appearance. The propeller is behind the wing, so it (and the motor) is less likely to be damaged in a crash.
*.	FMS Sky Trainer 182: This is a scale model of the Cessna 182, known for its realistic looks and smooth flying characteristics. It's available in both RTF and PNP (Plug-N-Play) versions, and offers a great balance between stability and performance for beginners.
*.	Flyzone Sensei FS: This is a versatile trainer plane that comes in both RTF and PNP versions. It offers a durable foam construction, brushless motor, and flaps for improved control during takeoff and landing. It also has a large wingspan for added stability and is capable of aerobatics once you gain more experience.
It's important to choose a beginner-friendly RC airplane that matches your skill level and interests, and always follow the manufacturer's recommendations and safety guidelines. Additionally, consider joining online communities, such as the subreddit for RC airplanes, to connect with experienced users who can provide further advice and support as you start your RC flying journey.

4. What's the difference between RTF, BNF, PNP, and ARTF?
* RTF (Ready-to-Fly) comes with everything you need to get started, including a transmitter, receiver, battery, and charger.
* BNF (Bind-aNd-Fly) comes with a receiver, for people who already have a transmitter (of the right protocol), batteries and charger. Ideal when adding to your fleet.
* PNP (Plug-aNd-Play) No receiver. For people who use a different protocol radio to the one used by the plane manufacturer.
* ARTF (Almost-Ready-To-Fly). These often don't come with any electronics, but construction is still just gluing a few large foam pieces together. Ideal if you have lots of electronics salvaged from a previous model.
